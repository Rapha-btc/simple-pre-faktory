## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. Function Signature Updates (Fixed Existing Tests)

- **buy-up-to function**: Updated all expectations from `responseOkCV(trueCV())` to `responseOkCV(uintCV(actual-seats))`
- **refund function**: Added `[noneCV()]` parameter to all refund calls and updated expectations from `responseOkCV(trueCV())` to `responseOkCV(uintCV(refunded-seats))`

### 2. New Refund Authorization Tests

Added comprehensive test coverage for the new refund authorization logic:

```typescript
describe("refund authorization with agent registry", () => {
  it("should allow seat owner to refund on behalf of themselves explicitly");
  it(
    "should fail when non-seat-owner tries to refund for someone else without agent registry authorization"
  );
  it(
    "should fail when non-owner tries to refund with none parameter for someone else"
  );
  it(
    "should allow owner to refund on behalf of their agent contract via registry lookup"
  );
});
```

### 3. Test Scenarios Covered

**Authorization Scenarios:**

- ✅ Seat owner can refund their own seats (existing behavior)
- ✅ Seat owner can explicitly specify themselves as the refund target
- ✅ Non-authorized users cannot refund on behalf of others
- ✅ Agent registry integration: Contract owners can refund on behalf of their registered agent contracts

**Cross-chain Scenarios (existing):**

- ✅ Payer vs owner separation in seat purchases
- ✅ Seat owners (not payers) can claim tokens
- ✅ Fee distributions go to seat owners (not payers)
- ✅ Refunds go to seat owners (not payers)

### 4. Safety Guarantees

Our comprehensive test suite ensures that:

1. **Function signature changes are backward compatible** - all existing functionality works with new signatures
2. **Authorization is properly enforced** - only authorized parties can request refunds
3. **Agent registry integration works correctly** - owners can manage their registered agent contracts
4. **Cross-chain functionality is preserved** - payer/owner separation continues to work as expected
5. **No unauthorized access** - attempted exploitation of the new authorization logic fails appropriately

The test suite validates that the adapter signature changes maintain security while adding the new agent registry authorization functionality.
