;; - hacker buys a lot of tokens but not to the point where it bonds
;; - hacker makes someone to buy for several bitcoins via a proxy contract -> it bonds
;; - hacker (sells) steals the abnormal amounts of bitcoins in the AMM

;; frontend and agent tools prevent from overbuying versus amount to graduation, but not smart contract...
;; therefore makes sense to enforce fat finger protection at the smart contract level
;; but at this point they can also directly deplete the sBTC from user wallet
;; this protects against a genuine FAT finger mistake though
